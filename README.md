Peasant is a LinkedIn reconnaissance utility written in Python3
that functions much like 
[LinkedInt](https://github.com/vysecurity/LinkedInt) by 
[@vysecurity](https://twitter.com/vysecurity). It authenticates
to LinkedIn and uses the API to perform several tasks.

- Profile information harvesting
- Automated connection requests
- Profile spoofing, i.e. update your profile with the content of
another

Output from profile harvesting is provided in CSV format for simple
processing. The following output was extracted when targeting the
`dundermifflindesign` profile:

```
first_name,last_name,occupation,public_identifier,industry,location,entity_urn,company_name,company_id,connection_requested

```

# Requirements

_Note_: I intend to create a Docker image for this eventually
...but until then

Peasant requires Python3.7 or greater. If on Debian, Use the 
following command to install dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Usage

## Profile Harvesting

By supplying one or more company names to the `harvest` command,
Peasant will make API calls to acquire the numeric identifier of
a target company identifier and proceed to enumerate employees
from the people section of the target company.

### Example

If the target is Dunder Mifflin Design and the company name was
found to be `dundermifflindesign` via search engine, then the
following command would attempt to harvest profiles and write CSV
records to dundermifflin.csv:

_WARNING_: Use of the `-ac` flag will result in a connection request
being sent to each accessible profile. If you wish to filter for
particular profiles, use the `-of` flag to dump the results to disk
and select specific records via grep and use the `add_contacts`
subcommand to create connection requests.

```
archangel@deskjet~~> export creds='username_here:password_here' # or interactive authentication 
archangel@deskjet~~> ./peasant.py harvest -C "$creds" -cns dundermifflindesign -of dundermifflin.csv

### Limitations

LinkedIn will allow only the first 1,000 search results to be
returned when harvesting contact information, however the same
results are not returned each time a series of searches are
applied. Run the harvest command multiple times to capture more
contacts.

Here are two ways to increase the number of contacts a given profile
can access:

1. Generate connection requests for company people via the `add_contacts`
subcommand or the `-ac` flag of the `harvest` command
2. Update the target profile such that you are in a position at the target
company. This appears to facilitate access to more contacts initially.

## Connection Request Generation

Use the `add_contacts` subcommand to generate connection requests for
target profiles. This command takes the name of a CSV file generated
by the `harvest` subcommand and will indiscriminately send a connection
request for each record.

### Example

To send a connection request to each of the profiles enumerated from 
Dunder Mifflin, run the following command. After execution, visit
the `My Network` tab of your LinkedIn profile to observe the connection
requests.

_Bonus_: Use the `-m` flag of this subcommand to send a custom message
to the recipients, just be aware that this is still being tested.

```
archangel@deskjet:peasant~> ./peasant.py add_contacts -if dundermifflin.csv -C "$creds"

## Profile Spoofing

Use the `spoof_profile` command to spoof basic profile information, along with
education and experience from a target profile back to the one associated with
credentials passed at the command line. This is useful during social engineering
engagements where impersonating a profile may enhance legitimacy of a pretext.
The target profile is selected by using the publicly available profile label
found on the profile page.

_Warning_: This command only spoofs textual information. Images will need to be
extracted and applied accordingly.

_Double Warning_: This will permanently overwrite the content of the authenticated
profile with that of the target profile.

### Example

The following command could be ran to spoof the profile of Paul M. at
Dunder Mifflin. After execution, review the authenticated profile and observe
that it has been updated with the information from the target profile.

```
archangel@deskjet:peasant~> ./peasant.py spoof_profile -pu paul-m-04773b1 -C "$creds"
